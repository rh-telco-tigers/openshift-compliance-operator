The Compliance Operator lets OpenShift Container Platform administrators describe the desired compliance state of a cluster and provides them with an overview of gaps and ways to remediate them.

The Compliance Operator uses OpenSCAP, a NIST-certified tool, to scan and enforce security policies provided by the content.
